  While starting a new year it is good to set up new goals. But we should be
  careful with the new goals which are the first time for us. We should make
  some preparations before starting the goals. In this way, instead of starting
  new goals immediately, we can start to habituate to realize these goals.

  In 2020, a goal of mine is improving my English. Although I have been using
  English in my life for 6 years. I notice the lack of my English knowledge. I
  can understand the frequently used words which I encountered, but sometimes
  the words which are not frequently used becomes hard to understand for me. The
  school generally dwells on grammar and writing, the listening and speaking are
  staying weak for students. Whereas, A word that you can understand when you
  read, is not understood when you listen. Because in listening some differences
  are varying from person to person and culture to culture. I have decided to
  improve my English Because I noticed the situation. I think to start watching
  at least one English video every day.


  The other goal of mine in 2020 is learning Linux deeper. It is because if you
  understand an operating system, you also understand well the many things on
  that operating system such as software and networks. So I think that it will
  give me many things for my professional development.


  The last goal of mine which seems to be unimportant is reading philosophy, but
  I think it is so important. Because philosophy improves thinking. If we want
  to throw a new idea into the pot, we should read the philosophy. Because
  philosophy examines deeply the subject which is ignored by most of the people.
  We do not know how we are sure that the fundamental things are accuracy and
  precision, however, we try to build new ideas constantly. How can you raise a
  building which has a skewed base?
